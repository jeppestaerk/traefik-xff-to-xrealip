summary: |
  ✨ Pinpoint the correct client IP! This Traefik plugin intelligently sets `X-Real-Ip` 
  by selecting an IP from the `X-Forwarded-For` header using a customizable `depth` (index).
  🌐 Ideal for multi-proxy setups (e.g., behind Cloudflare). Get the real client IP, every time! 🚀

testData:
  depth: 1 # Example: pick the second IP (index 1)
  Headers:
    X-Forwarded-For: "203.0.113.5, 10.0.0.1, 192.168.0.100"
